# shooting-game
This is a simple, fun and exciting shooting game made using python. To make the game, i have imported the python "turtle" library, which contains methods and things essential to form blocks/characters, control direction, connecting the user's keyboard to the game, etc. You can use the "left" and "right" arrow keys to control direction and turn left/right. Use the "up" arrow key to accelerate, and the "down" arrow key to slow down. You can copy-paste this code into your code-editor/shell, play around with it, and have some fun- change colours, increase/decrease difficulty levels, change sizes of characters- anything using your own imagination!
